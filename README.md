A look at meme stonks from December 2020 to March 2021.

The motivation for this project was driven by the extreme volatility and potential profits offered by meme stocks such as GME (Gamestop) or AMC (AMC Theatres). Particularly in late January, the stocks were widely discussed on social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. At this time both stocks experienced wild periods of growth and contraction bringing them both wide attention. It is widely suspected that these fluctuations are the result of retail traders (smaller traders who alone mean very little, but together have much influence and capital). Due to the influence from retail traders and their presence on social media, we believe that sentiment analysis can be used to analyze the opinions of retail traders on a given stock through social media and this data could potentially be used to predict the next movements of these stocks as well as other stocks with smaller market capitals that gain the attention of retail traders.
